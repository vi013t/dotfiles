# AwesomeWM Assets

This folder is for assets used by the AwesomeWM config, such as images, sounds, etc. In [`preferences.lua`](https://github.com/vi013t/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/awesome/preferences.lua) the location of individual assets can be set, but I personally find it convenient to have them all within the Awesome config.

See [`preferences.lua`](https://github.com/vi013t/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/awesome/preferences.lua) for specifics of where and how each asset is used.
